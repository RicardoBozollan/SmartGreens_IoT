# SmartGreens_IoT
 Smart garden with ESP32, powered by SBC like Raspberry Pi. Communication via MQTT, SBC acts as broker and hosts Node-RED. Automates care for small plants, monitoring and controlling environmental conditions remotely.


Motivation:

The motivation behind the SmartGreens IoT project lies in the intention to facilitate the cultivation of plants and gardens, especially for individuals with busy schedules and little time available for gardening. Through the implementation of IoT technology in embedded systems, the goal is to enable people to care for their plants remotely and automatically, eliminating the need for constant manual intervention. This provides an accessible and intuitive solution for those who wish to cultivate gardens and/or plants at home, but may lack the experience or time to do so in a traditional manner.
